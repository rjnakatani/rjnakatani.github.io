## Profile  

I'm interested in utilizing various mathematical models in elucidating underlying molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena.
Currently I'm studying astrocytes and their actually quite dynamic electrophysiological properties using NEURON.
Further information can be found in [AboutMe](/about.markdown).
