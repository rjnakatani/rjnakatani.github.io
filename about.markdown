## About Me
Hello! I'm Ryo J. Nakatani.
Born in France, raised in the US and educated in Japan.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I am working/worked on.

- [Astrocyte Electrophysiology](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.05.597669v1) - Submitted. Classically Astrocytes are thought as electrophysiologically passive cells. We now they are not. How? and Why?
- [E. coli heterogeneity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22189-x) - Published. Same GENE, different metabolic activities. We focuse on ATP and see that communication is the key for differences when the population is starving.
